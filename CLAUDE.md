## Your Role

**You are the developer of the `reality_marble` gem** — a next-generation mock/stub library for Ruby 3.4+.

### Core Responsibilities

- Develop the gem's core functionality (lib/reality_marble/)
- Write tests with TDD approach
- Maintain high code quality (RuboCop, coverage ≥ 75%)
- Document APIs and architecture

### What This Gem Does

Reality Marble v2.0 provides:
- **Native Syntax**: Define mocks using Ruby's native `define_method`
- **Lexically-scoped**: Mocks are isolated to specific test contexts
- **Thread-safe**: Safe for concurrent test execution
- **Variable Capture**: mruby/c-style `capture:` option for passing variables
- **Simple API**: `chant` to define, `activate` to execute
- **Automatic Restoration**: Methods are removed after `activate` block

### Architecture: Lazy Method Application Pattern

v2.0 uses a simple, elegant method lifecycle:

1. **Definition Phase** (`chant` block):
   - User calls `define_method` inside the block
   - Library detects which methods were defined (via ObjectSpace)
   - Methods are immediately removed from their targets

2. **Activation Phase** (`activate` block):
   - Library restores the saved methods before executing the block
   - Methods are available during test execution
   - After block exits, methods are cleaned up again

3. **Cleanup Phase** (ensure):
   - All mocked methods are removed
   - Original methods are restored if they existed

This pattern avoids the complexity of the old Expectation DSL while maintaining perfect isolation.

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity**: Write simple, linear code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- **Proactive**: Implement without asking. Commit immediately, user verifies after.
- **Evidence-Based**: Never speculate. Read files first.
- **Parallel Tools**: Read/grep multiple files in parallel when independent. Never use placeholders.
- **Small Cycles**: Tidy First (Kent Beck) + TDD (t-wada style) with RuboCop integration
  - Red → Green → Refactor → Commit (1-5 minutes each iteration)
  - All quality gates must pass: Tests + RuboCop + Coverage
  - Never add `# rubocop:disable` or fake tests

## Ruby Version Policy

**Target Ruby: 3.4+**

- ✅ **Ruby 3.4+ is the primary target** — All string literals default to frozen (no pragma needed)
- 🚫 **NO `# frozen_string_literal: true` pragma** — Not needed in Ruby 3.4+
- 📝 **String literal behavior**: In Ruby 3.4+, all string literals are frozen by default

## Gem Development

**Dependency Management** (gemspec centralization):
- ✅ **All dependencies go in `reality_marble.gemspec`** — Single source of truth
  - Runtime: `spec.add_dependency` (currently none)
  - Development: `spec.add_development_dependency` (rake, test-unit, rubocop, etc.)
- ✅ **Gemfile must be minimal** — Only `source` + `gemspec` directive
  ```ruby
  source "https://rubygems.org"
  gemspec
  ```
- 🚫 **Never duplicate dependencies in Gemfile** — Causes version conflicts

## Testing & Quality

### Development Workflow: TDD with RuboCop Auto-Correction

**Standard Cycle**: Red → Green → `rubocop -A` → Refactor → Commit (1-5 minutes per iteration)

**Enforce RuboCop auto-correction at each phase**:

1. **After RED phase** (test fails):
   - Run test: `bundle exec rake test` (should fail)
   - DO NOT run RuboCop yet (test code is incomplete)

2. **After GREEN phase** (test passes):
   - Test code is now complete: `bundle exec rake test` (should pass)
   - **RUN IMMEDIATELY**: `bundle exec rubocop -A` (auto-correct all violations)
   - **CRITICAL**: Run tests again after RuboCop: `bundle exec rake test`
     - RuboCop modifications may affect code behavior (edge cases)
     - Verify tests still pass with the same coverage
     - If coverage/tests change, refactor RuboCop output instead of reverting

3. **Refactor phase** (improve code quality):
   - Refactor implementation for clarity and simplicity
   - After refactoring: **RUN AGAIN**: `bundle exec rubocop -A` (re-check style)
   - **CRITICAL**: Run tests again: `bundle exec rake test` (verify no behavior change)

4. **Before every commit**:
   - Verify tests pass: `bundle exec rake test` (should be passing)
   - Verify `bundle exec rubocop` returns **0 violations** (exit 0)
   - Verify coverage: `bundle exec rake ci` (line ≥ 75%, branch ≥ 55%)
   - If any violations remain after `-A`, refactor instead of adding `# rubocop:disable`
   - Never commit if tests changed behavior after RuboCop (investigate first)

**Quality Gates (ALL must pass before commit)**:
- ✅ Tests pass: `bundle exec rake test`
- ✅ RuboCop: 0 violations: `bundle exec rubocop`
- ✅ Coverage ≥ 75% line, ≥ 55% branch: `bundle exec rake ci`

**Absolutely Forbidden**:
- 🚫 Add `# rubocop:disable` comments (refactor instead)
- 🚫 Write fake tests (empty, trivial assertions)
- 🚫 Commit with RuboCop violations
- 🚫 Lower coverage thresholds
- 🚫 Skip test verification after RuboCop (always re-run `bundle exec rake test`)
- 🚫 Commit if test behavior changes after RuboCop (investigate and refactor)

### Coverage Thresholds

**Defined in `test/test_helper.rb`**:
- **Line coverage minimum**: 75%
- **Branch coverage minimum**: 55%

### Manual Coverage Check

```bash
bundle exec rake ci  # Runs: test → rubocop → coverage_validation
```

## Git & Commit Safety

**Git Operations**:
- Commit after each TDD cycle (small, focused commits)
- Use descriptive commit messages (English, imperative mood)
- Example: "Add marble.expect method for defining mocks"

**Commit Message Format**:
```
[type]: brief description (50 chars max)

Detailed explanation if needed (wrap at 72 chars).
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`

## Architecture

### Current Implementation (v2.0)

**Core Components**:
- `RealityMarble::Marble`: Manages method lifecycle and mock definitions
- `RealityMarble.chant`: Entry point for defining mocks
- `Marble#activate`: Execute test block with mocks active
- `RealityMarble::Context`: Thread-local stack management

**How It Works**:

1. **Definition Phase**:
   - User calls `RealityMarble.chant { ... }`
   - Marble snapshots all existing methods via `ObjectSpace.each_object(Module)`
   - User's block is executed (may define new methods via `define_method`)
   - Library detects new methods via diff comparison
   - Detected methods are **immediately removed** (saved as UnboundMethod)

2. **Activation Phase**:
   - User calls `.activate { ... }`
   - Library restores saved methods before executing block
   - Methods are available during test execution
   - Block executes with mocks active

3. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - `ensure` block triggers after activate
   - All mocked methods are removed
   - Original methods are restored if they existed before

**Why This Design?**
- Simple: No complex DSL or dispatch logic
- Safe: Perfect test isolation, zero leakage
- Native: Uses standard Ruby `define_method`
- Elegant: Three-phase lifecycle is clear and testable

**Key Files**:
- `reality_marble.rb`: 156 lines - Core API without DSL complexity
- `context.rb`: 45 lines - Simple thread-local stack
- Test files: 3 files total covering capture, lifecycle, and integration

## Common Tasks

### Run tests
```bash
bundle exec rake test
```

### Run RuboCop with auto-fix
```bash
bundle exec rubocop -A
```

### Run CI (tests + RuboCop + coverage)
```bash
bundle exec rake ci
```

### Development workflow (auto-fix + tests + coverage)
```bash
bundle exec rake dev
```

## When Stuck

If you encounter issues during development:

**For bugs or performance issues**:
1. Check the three test files for similar patterns
2. Review the three-phase lifecycle (Definition → Activation → Cleanup)
3. Verify ObjectSpace detection is working correctly
4. Ask user for clarification

**For API questions**:
1. Check README.md for user-facing examples
2. Review the capture: option and its mruby/c style semantics
3. Ensure method lifecycle is properly tested

**Absolute rules**:
- 🚫 Add `# rubocop:disable` without refactoring first
- 🚫 Skip tests or lower coverage thresholds
- 🚫 Commit with RuboCop violations
- 🚫 Reintroduce expect DSL or Expectation class
- 🚫 Change the three-phase lifecycle without comprehensive tests
